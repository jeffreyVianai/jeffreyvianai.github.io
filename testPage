title: Optimizing Models 
description: You can deploy your model as you registered it, or optimize it with open source optimization tools, such as ONNX and PyTorch, or use Vianai's proprietary optimization called DVQ.

#### Prerequisites

- The model to optimize must have been registered. See [Registering Models](main_registering_models.html).

#### Procedure

1. Open the platform to the **Optimize Models** tab.  
   - The entire folder structure of registered models appears in the main window.
   - If you just registered the model, then the folder system expands to show that model and the versions registered under it.  

1. Click version (v1, v2, etc.) under the name of the registered model you want to optimize.  

   A list with the available optimization methods expands under the version, and a chart with control buttons appears in the right panel.  

1. Check the **Optimize** button in the right panel.  

	The **Optimization Preferences** dialog box appears.

1. Check any of the optimizations you want to run.

1. Click **Confirm**.

1. Monitor the job in the **Jobs** window. 

1. Click the **Optimization Results** button to view details of the different optimizations.


#### Results

You have optimized the model, and now you can deploy it. See [Deploying Models](main_deploying_models.html).
